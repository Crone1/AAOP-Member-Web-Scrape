# Overview
This repository contains the code I designed to scrape member details from the American Academy of Orofacial Pain (AAOP) website.

On their website, they have a search feature where members can be searched for and their details come up, this can be found here: https://aaop.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=2720&club_id=508439. Using this feature I could get the details of all mebers and scrape them into a simple CSV.

I completed this task to get a better understanding of web scraping and to practically explore it in more detail.
